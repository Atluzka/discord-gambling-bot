	  INFO
</h3>

Obviously this bot does not use any real money. Its all fake. To use, simply put your discord bot token inside config.json file which u can get from <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">here</a>.

This bot makes the database for you, so you dont have to worry about that. You can view the database file by using programs such as <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/">this</a> one. I'm using the Windows PortableApp.

Admin only command `/money [amount] {userid}`, u can use this to give people money to gamble with. To add or remove admins, check out the config.json file where u can find a list of admins. Add your userid to that list and u can use the money command. You can search online if you dont know how to get your userid, it will take you a minute

If you have any suggestions or you've found an error with the program please let me know, thank you.
