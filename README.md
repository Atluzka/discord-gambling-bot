	  INFO
</h3>

Obviously this bot does not use any real money. Its all fake. To use, simply put your discord bot token inside config.json file which u can get from <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">here</a>.

This bot makes the database for you, so you dont have to worry about that. You can view the database file by using programs such as <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/">this</a> one. I'm using the Windows PortableApp. It doesn't have per server data.

If you have any suggestions or you've found an error with the program please let me know, thank you.
